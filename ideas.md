A better writing tool

Instead of having to do inline suggestions, can we have a scratchpad for a phrase? E.g. I’m working on different ways to say “I crashed the car.” Can I have a little dropdown scratchpad where I can write alternatives out?

Multiple layers of edits. Instead of word choice edits being side by side with layout edits, can we split them up into different “views”? Then, a writer can tackle one at a time.

Can an LLM assist you better? A local model could go off and think about your piece for a long time and give you continual suggestions.

A notes section that is very powerful? 

Some functionality that encourages you to keep writing without editing at first.

Phrase/word suggestions 

Detailed explanations of critiques and why things could be better.

Attributes! (Like the ones in embeddings: conciseness vs. detail, abstract vs. concrete, etc.)

“We sharpen your writing. We don’t write it.”

Above all, I want a tool that helps me 1. Find my voice and style and tone and 2. Become as good as I can at writing in general and in that voice/style/tone.

Embedding/latent space explorer

Will SAEs help? Perhaps if a user struggles with an attribute, we can activate that attribute in the local model more, and it will then give suggestions to bring that attribute into the writing.

Goals for the current writing session.
